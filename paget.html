                    You found it!<br><br>
                    Good Question, Still on the fence.<br>
                    yup.<br>
                    Part of me wants to wear dresses and do my hair really girly, but theres still that part of me that wants a full beard, and a six pack, but more of me wants to go to the beach in a one piece or go shopping in town and spend hours trying on cute clothes.<br><br>

                    since stopping my transition in early 2019, I thought I was content being a man. But now I feel I was trying to "reinvent" myself after my "breakup" with my "first girlfriend". After leaving school, I was too busy to think about my gender. keeping myself busy with work may have been a coping mechanism. I do regret not going back to the youth health center after deciding not to continue my transition, I might have been able to think about why I wanted to stop my transition, or at least I might have been able to be pursuaded to stay on the blockers for a little while longer, while giving me time to make sure I had made the right descision.

                    For a while I tried to give up wearing my girls clothes, thinking that it was some kind of fetish, but in the last year I decided that I would embrace it, In doing so I definately noticed that while wearing them I feel better about myself. since imbracing this part of me, I considered that I may be a crossdresser, at day I could be a man, in my career, and in my family life, and a woman at home and maybe with friends. And at first that satisfied me, but after a while I felt like it wasnt quite the right description. then a few months later, I thought I may be more of a femboy, and I quite enjoyed that prospect, the cute girly dresses, the emphasis on femininity, the more sexual conotation, but once again, time showed me that that wasnt quite right too.

                    A few months ago, October or November, my orthodontist brought up the subject of transgender women, and how he saw a new documentery by a man who went around asking different people what defined a woman. and how this man went to an african tribe in kenya and asked if anyone in there tribe was trans gender, and the villagers response to that was "whats that". he being a south afican himself seemed to agree with the sentiment. I believe he asked what my stance on it was, at the time I was still in denial and was of the mind that what I had was just a fetish, and I said something along the lines of "its people with no problems in there lives making some" I nearly instantly regretted it and felt such shame. he sounded like he agreed with it so I didnt dare say any more.
                    I am not sure if I added anything to the tune of "I still support them if that is their descision though" but I thought it. but thinking it isnt the same as saying it.

                    I don't think he's a bad guy or anything, he's been nothing but good to me, but after what I had said I felt a fear of being descovered like I had'nt in a long time. well adding to that was the fact that the assistant presant that day had previously said she fully believes the moon landings were faked, so I had no Idea what they were truly thinking. not long after this encounter, I was shown an ad for this documentary by youtube, and the first 30 seconds seemed quite interesting, the question was posed, what defines a woman, I was quite intregued by the beginning thinking it may be pormoting a more in depth look into gender lines and freedom of expression, but then the mood changed and it leaned much more onto the side of being trans is unnatural and all of that bullshit. I felt absolutely disgusted by it. after I thought about it again and maybe the reason those villagers dont have anything like trans people in there tribes may not be that more develpoed countrys have less to worrie about so they come up with things to worrie about. and may be more the fact that they have to worrie so much about their survival that they dont have time to think about less life treatening things the likes of gender and sexuality and the like. maybe if they didn't have to worrie about the survival of their familys on a day to day basis then maybe more of their people may identify as trans. I dont know, I'm not a researcher, I juat wanted to say that that documentary made me so sick.

                    sometimes I think was that an enquiry into weather I was regretting my descision to not transition. but if it was it was going the wrong way about it.

                    around this time last year one of my friends decided to lose a lot of weight, and they did, and not too much later did they come out and say they wanted to be refered to as they/them, I was and am in full support of them, since then they have been wearing alot more feminine clothes and I've felt very happy for them, more recently they asked about my experience with gender transition, and came out as trans. and some part of me wasn't expecting that, of course I was delighted, but with that happening, is started the wheels turning in my head again. what if I am trans? am I sure Im a man.
                    this led me to thinking "hang on, I still havent worn a propper girly dress yet". so I decided I needed to go buy a dress. I went and got 2 dresses from the warehouse, and when I put that first dress on I realised that I couldnt go back to not wearing dresses again, I had to at least wear one every once in a while. and so it began once again, am I trans?
