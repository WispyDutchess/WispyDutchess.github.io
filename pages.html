                <p>
                    I had the Idea to get Chat GPT-3 to write a parody of It's Raining Men by The Weather Girls called I'm Blaming Sven.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>This was the result:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    (Verse 1:)<br>
                    I'm sitting here inside, feeling kinda blue<br>
                    Looking at the weather, it's not something new<br>
                    It's pouring down with rain, it's a total mess<br>
                    I'm gonna lose my mind, this is my best guess<br>
                    <br>
                    (Pre-Chorus:)<br>
                    I look outside my window, and what do I see?<br>
                    Sven, my neighbor, laughing maniacally<br>
                    He's standing in the rain, without a care<br>
                    But he's the reason why I'm tearing out my hair<br>
                    <br>
                    (Chorus:)<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah<br>
                    He's the reason why it's raining cats and dogs, hallelujah<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, he's gone too far<br>
                    He's got the weather on his side, I can't take it anymore<br>
                    <br>
                    (Verse 2:)<br>
                    I tried to talk to him, but he just grinned<br>
                    Said he was doing a dance, it's his little sin<br>
                    He said he prayed for rain, to water his lawn<br>
                    But I think he did it, just to make me mourn<br>
                    <br>
                    (Pre-Chorus:)<br>
                    I look outside my window, and what do I see?<br>
                    Sven, my neighbor, still dancing gleefully<br>
                    He's making it rain, just to spite me<br>
                    But I won't give up, I'll fight for my sanity<br>
                    <br>
                    (Chorus:)<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah<br>
                    He's the reason why it's raining cats and dogs, hallelujah<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, he's gone too far<br>
                    He's got the weather on his side, I can't take it anymore<br>
                    <br>
                    (Bridge:)<br>
                    I don't know what to do, I'm at my wit's end<br>
                    But I won't give up, I'll keep on fighting, my friend<br>
                    I'll find a way to stop him, to end this rain<br>
                    And then I'll finally have my peace of mind again<br>
                    <br>
                    (Chorus:)<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah<br>
                    He's the reason why it's raining cats and dogs, hallelujah<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, he's gone too far<br>
                    He's got the weather on his side, I can't take it anymore<br>
                    <br>
                    (Outro:)<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah<br>
                    I'm blaming Sven, hallelujah.<br>
